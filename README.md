# RoyalRoxnDatabse

 I developed and applied a fully normalized relational database to the "Royal Roxn" system. Created several tables based on dependencies using 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF methodologies to remove the dual storing of attributes. Designed schema for departments and employees, vendors and other main apexes with their subtypes and other managements with related keys made as foreign.
